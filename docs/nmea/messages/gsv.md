## GSV - GNSS Satellites in View

### Summary

This is one of the 7 sentences commonly emitted by GPS / GNSS units.

The GSV sentences include the SV ID, elevation, azimuth, and signal strength (C/No) values for up to 4 satellites.

In a multi-GNSS system, sets of the GSV message will be output multiple times, one set for each GNSS.

Notes:

- Receivers may emit more than 12 quadruples (more than three GSV sentences), even though NMEA-0813 doesnâ€™t allow this.
- The final sentence may include data for less than 4 satellites, if the number of visible satellites is not divisible by 4.
- It is not entirely clear whether GSV reports carrier-to-noise density (C/N<sub>0</sub>) in dB-Hz or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) - see related [article](https://insidegnss.com/measuring-gnss-signal-strength/).
- The GNSS [signal ID](../lookups/signal-id.md) was added in NMEA 4.10.
